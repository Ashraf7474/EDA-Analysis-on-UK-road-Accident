# Methodology

Data Acquisition: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle, encompassing UK road accident data for the year 2022.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thoroughly analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights into accident occurrences, weather conditions, vehicle types, and other relevant attributes.

Machine Learning Model Development: Build a predictive model that takes inputs such as weather conditions, road type, and light conditions to forecast accident types, enhancing the ability to preemptively address potential risks.

Excel Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard visually representing real-time accident data, trends, and predictions, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance road safety measures.

PowerPoint Presentation: Compile the project's findings, methodologies, and dashboard visuals into a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will serve as a medium to effectively communicate the project's results, insights, and potential business implications.

#  Aggregation on Different KPIâ€™s
To check the Co-relationship between different Variables to each other. By analyzing the heatmap, we can learn about the strength and direction of these correlations, 
identifying which variables are highly related to each other. Heatmaps also help in identifying important features and detecting multicollinearity, 
which can impact model performance and interpretation.
