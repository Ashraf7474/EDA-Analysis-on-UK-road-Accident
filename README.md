# --Introduction--

Introducing our holistic project focused on UK road safety: through Exploratory Data Analysis, we unveil accident trends; our predictive Machine Learning model enhances prevention strategies, and an interactive dashboard using Excel that empowers real-time data-driven decisions. By merging insights, predictions, and visualization, we aspire to elevate road safety and contribute to a safer, informed society.

# --Problem aimed to solve--  

Our project tackles the challenge of improving UK road safety. By analyzing accident data, creating a predictive model, and offering real-time insights through a dashboard, we aim to empower effective decision-making and reduce accidents, ultimately contributing to a safer road environment.

# --Data Description--
CSV File:- Our provided CSV file encompasses the entire year of 2022 and presents a comprehensive dataset of UK road accidents. It includes critical information such as accident details, weather conditions, vehicle types, and specific dates. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to uncover accident trends, assess contributing factors, and propose data-driven safety enhancements.

# --Phases--
Data Acquisition: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle, encompassing UK road accident data for the year 2022.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thoroughly analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights into accident occurrences, weather conditions, vehicle types, and other relevant attributes.

Machine Learning Model Development: Build a predictive model that takes inputs such as weather conditions, road type, and light conditions to forecast accident types, enhancing the ability to preemptively address potential risks.

Excel Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard visually representing real-time accident data, trends, and predictions, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance road safety measures.

PowerPoint Presentation: Compile the project's findings, methodologies, and dashboard visuals into a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will serve as a medium to effectively communicate the project's results, insights, and potential business implications.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
To check the Co-relationship between different Variables to each other. By analyzing the heatmap, we can learn about the strength and direction of these correlations, 
identifying which variables are highly related to each other. Heatmaps also help in identifying important features and detecting multicollinearity, 
which can impact model performance and interpretation.

# Insights
The number of Slight  cases  is very high approx. 85.5%  and Fatal approx. 1.3%

Most number Fatal, serious, and slight cases happen when the speed limit is 30 and 60 KMPH

Urban Areas is a greater Count of accidents as compared to rural

Most of The Fatal Type of cases have happened in rural areas

In the vehicle type Car has the highest accident rate in count and Number_of_Casualties itâ€™s approx. 25K

Dry-type road conditions have the highest accident rate. 21 K

And Most of the accidents occur in daylight time approx. 23K

The top 3 districts in the accident rate are Birmingham,Leeds, and Bradford 

# Challenges Faced

During the execution of our UK road safety project, we encountered several significant challenges. First and foremost, the data acquisition process involved handling a large and complex dataset, requiring careful data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy in our analysis.

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase brought challenges related to identifying meaningful patterns and correlations within the accident data, especially considering the multitude of factors involved in road accidents. Additionally, during the development of the Machine Learning model, we faced the challenge of selecting the most relevant features and optimizing model performance to accurately predict accident types.

Creating the interactive Excel dashboard demanded a strong understanding of data visualization techniques and Excel functionality to present real-time data effectively. Lastly, synthesizing our findings and insights into a concise PowerPoint presentation required effective communication skills to convey the project's value and potential impact on road safety measures. These challenges were met with dedication, expertise, and teamwork, ultimately contributing to the success of our project.
