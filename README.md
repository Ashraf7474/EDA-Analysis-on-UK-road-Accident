# Methodology

Data Acquisition: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle, encompassing UK road accident data for the year 2022.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thoroughly analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights into accident occurrences, weather conditions, vehicle types, and other relevant attributes.

Machine Learning Model Development: Build a predictive model that takes inputs such as weather conditions, road type, and light conditions to forecast accident types, enhancing the ability to preemptively address potential risks.

Excel Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard visually representing real-time accident data, trends, and predictions, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance road safety measures.

PowerPoint Presentation: Compile the project's findings, methodologies, and dashboard visuals into a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation will serve as a medium to effectively communicate the project's results, insights, and potential business implications.
